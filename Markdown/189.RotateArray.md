### 189. Rotate Array

Rotate an array of *n* elements to the right by *k* steps.

For example, with *n* = 7 and *k* = 3, the array `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]` is rotated to `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`.

**Note:**

        int digit = nums.length - k%nums.length;
        reverse(nums,0,digit);
        reverse(nums,digit,nums.length);
        reverse(nums,0,nums.length);
    }
    private void reverse(int[] nums, int start, int end){
        for(int i = 0; i < (end-start)/2;i++){
            int tmp = nums[i+start];
            nums[i+start] = nums[end-i-1];
            nums[end-i-1] = tmp;
        }
